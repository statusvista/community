# StatusVista

Hello and welcome to the StatusVista GitHub community! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant to host discussion of the
[StatusVista app](https://statusvista.com) using
[GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).
We take communication here very seriously and will do our best to make
adjustments to the app based on feedback from this community. If you need
immediate assistance, sending an email to
[contact@statusvista.com](mailto:contact@statusvista.com) is the fastest way to
get help.

# Participation

Log in to GitHub and
[open an issue](https://github.com/statusvista/community/issues/new) to start a
new topic. All topics are welcome whether you have a general question about the
app, you're looking for a new service to be added or anything else. Our customer
success team will be notified of new issues and will respond within 24 hours.
You may also reply or emote to existing issues to show support for it.

When creating a new issue, it's best to use a GitHub label appropriate to the
topic being discussed. For example: if you'd like to see a service supported, an
`enhancement` label would be a good choice. While totally optional, labels help
our success team prioritize issues and make sure you're assisted in a timely
manner.

Thanks for your support! ðŸ¥‚
